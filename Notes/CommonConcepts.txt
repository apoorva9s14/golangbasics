Convert blocking calls to a non-blocking execution.
Lift off I/O operations from the execution thread to the system's kernel.

Since most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background 
concurrenlty. When one of these operations completes, the kernel notifies the main thread and then the appropriate callback 
is eventually executed.
