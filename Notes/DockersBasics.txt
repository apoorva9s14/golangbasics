Docker Engine is a client server application. Components:
Server ==> long-running program called a daemon process
CLI client ==> the docker command
A REST API which specifies interfaces that programs can use to talk to the daemon and instruct it what to do.???

Dockerfile ==> instructions to build a Docker image

docker run:
1. Docker server checks for image in the local image registry,
    if not found, searches in remote registry
2. From remote registry image is downloaded and cached in local image registry
3. Docker server allocates and mounts a read-write layer. This layer will become the container's writable layer.??
???
4. Docker server allocates the virtual network interface to the container.
5. Networking system allocates an IP address for the virtual network interface. ???
